# Ecommerce site template

This template is part of The Odin Project curriculum, built with React and TypeScript. While TypeScript guidance was provided, I am not yet well-versed in it.

The project includes a landing page with a header, a hero image accompanied by a button that directs visitors to the products page, and a footer.

Engaging in this project introduced me to many new concepts within React. I dove headfirst into the useContext hook and scoured the React documentation to gain what I believe is a working grasp of its uses. I also explored the useReducer hook but ultimately decided against using it. If I had opted for JavaScript instead of TypeScript, I might have been more comfortable with the reducer, as I am still far from comfortable with TypeScript.

In the end, I am happy with the outcome. The goal was to create something purposely generic and minimal, and I believe thatâ€™s what I have achieved.
