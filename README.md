# Ecommerce site template

This template is part of The Odin Project curriculum, built with React and TypeScript. While TypeScript does make an appearance, I am not yet very confident working with it.

You will notce a checkout button if you decide to go through te motions of the website, it does not submit anything it, clears the cart.

Engaging in this project introduced me to many new concepts within React. I dove headfirst into the useContext hook and scoured the React documentation to gain what I believe is a working grasp of its uses. I also explored the useReducer hook but ultimately decided against using it. If I had opted for JavaScript instead of TypeScript, I might have been more comfortable with the reducer, as I am still far from comfortable with TypeScript.

In the end, I am happy with the outcome. The goal was to create something purposely generic and minimal, and I believe thatâ€™s what I have achieved.
